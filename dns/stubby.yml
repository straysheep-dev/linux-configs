# Validate a config, and get SSL/TLS certificate bundle and openssl information using:
# stubby -i ./stubby.yml

# Note that stubby does not cache responses, but can run perfectly fine on its own.
# For caching you can use bind9, unbound, or dnsmasq, and point them to stubby.
# Be sure to change the port stubby listens on so both DNS services can run simultaneously.

# In the case of Quad9 and Cloudflare, both perform DNSSEC for you.
# Authenticating to both with TLS makes performing DNSSEC twice unnecessary.
