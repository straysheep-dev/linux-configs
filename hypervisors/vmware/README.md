Configurations for VMware Workstation

### Preferences

Changing the `Default Location for Virtual Machines` under `Edit` > `Workspace` to an external drive for example, may result in no VM tabs being available when opening the VMware Workstation application.

To repopulated the tabs bar with all of your virtual machines, go to `View` > `Customize` > `Library`.

You'll see by clicking on each virtual machine, it will automatically be added as a tab in the UI.

Hold either the `^` or `v` arrows to scroll through the list and quickly populate the tabs bar.
